'''

We are going to write a programm that generates a random number & asks the user to guess it.

If the  player guesses is higher number than the actual numbers , the program displayes 
"Lower number please" similarly if the user's guesses is to low, the program prints 
"Higher number please" when the user guesses is to low ,the programm prints "Higher number please"
when the user guesses the correct number ,the programm displays the number of guesses the player 
used to arrive at the number

import random
print("Enter number:")
randNumber= random.randint(1,10)
#print(randNumber)
guesses=0
userguess=None

while(userguess!=randNumber):
    userguess=int(input("Enter Your choice:"))
    guesses+=1
    if(userguess== randNumber):
        print("User guessed it right!")
        
    else:
        if(userguess>=randNumber):
            print("You Guessed it the wrong number enter smaller number")
        else:
            print("You Guessed it the wrong number enter larger number")

    

print(f"You guessed the number in {guesses} guesses")

with open("Project_Python.txt","r") as f:
    Project_Python=int(f.read())

if guesses<Project_Python:
    print("You have just Broken the highscore...Well Played!")
    with open("Project_Python.txt","w") as f:
        f.write(str(guesses))
